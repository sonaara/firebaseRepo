# Getting started

## Install stuff
- cd into `sonaara-prototype`, run `npm install`
- do the same for `functions`

## Run stuff
- open a terminal, cd into `sonaara-prototype`, run `npm start`
- open another terminal, cd into `functions`, run `npm run serve`

## Other notes
NOTE: always use node 18. Eric got some warnings/errors when trying to run node 20.

To switch to node 18 using `nvm`, run the command `nvm use 18`.
- In case that version of node isn't installed, first install it by running `nvm install 18`
